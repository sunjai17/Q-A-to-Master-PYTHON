    "4. **Performance:**\n",

When you assign a list to a variable, the variable doesn't directly store the list's elements; instead, it holds a reference to the memory location where the list is stored.

    "`copy.copy()` and `copy.deepcopy()` are both functions provided by the `copy` module in Python for creating copies of objects. However, they differ in how they handle nested objects, particularly with respect to mutability and immutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`copy.copy()`:**\n",
    "   - `copy.copy()` performs a shallow copy of an object.\n",
    "   - It creates a new object, but if the original object contains references to other objects (such as nested lists or dictionaries), it only copies the references, not the nested objects themselves. This means changes to the nested objects in the copy will affect the original, and vice versa.\n",
    "   - It's suitable for objects that don't contain mutable objects or when you don't need to create a completely independent copy of nested objects.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import copy\n",
    "     \n",
    "     original_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\n",
    "     copied_list = copy.copy(original_list)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`copy.deepcopy()`:**\n",
    "   - `copy.deepcopy()` performs a deep copy of an object.\n",
    "   - It recursively creates copies of all nested objects within the original object, so the new object is completely independent of the original. Changes to the nested objects in the copy will not affect the original, and vice versa.\n",
    "   - It's suitable for objects that contain nested mutable objects or when you need to create a completely independent copy of all nested objects.\n",
